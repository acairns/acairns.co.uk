Thinking of building an API? Well don't, because <a href="twitter.com/philsturgeon" target="_blank">@philsturgeon</a> has done all the thinking for you! Quite a while ago I was asked to give a review of <a href="https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate" target="_blank">_Build API's you won't hate_</a> which I jumped at since it's my favourite area of software development. Granted, it's taken me a while to get around to writing the review - but here it is!

I've been building APIs for a long time now so when I heard Phil was writing this book, I was excited to give it a read. One of his main motivations for writing the book was the fact that many resources online are either terrible or specific to a single framework - an annoyance of which I can relate.

APIs are becoming really common now with many services being API-centric. This means that new developers entering the industry absolutely must understand what an API is, how to consume them and possibly how to build and maintain one. If this sounds like it could be you, then you are in luck - because this book will get you up-to-speed with APIs in no time!

Alright, so I guess you've picked up on the fact that I think the book is pretty good - but why is that? Quite simply - the topics that have been covered. Because of the aforementioned bastardisation of online resources; we as developers have many ways to skin a cat, sledgehammers to crack nuts and lots of metaphors to use when writing book reviews. For each topic, Phil goes into detail and discusses the pros and cons of many popular approaches and explains why a particular technique is useful in a specific scenario.

So you want an example? Sure, let's talk about the first hurdle someone will encounter when consuming your API: authentication. How are you gonna handle this? Username and passwords? Lets not. How about API Keys? Sure, that could be interesting, but how do determine the difference between a third-party iPhone app, web app or some sort of service? How would you go about rate-limiting a particular app or grant specific permissions to a particular client? Maybe you've heard of OAuth - that could work? Maybe, or is it overkill for your needs? Sounds like you need to read the chapter on Authentication.

Another reason I enjoyed _"Build API's you won't hate"_ was that it covered things which get debated on over-and-over again. Each time you start building a new API, decisions need to be made regarding the format your output, how to handle pagination, versioning, etc. Often the answer to these questions are "it depends", but what's nice about this book is that Phil has gone to a lot of effort to include many answers to these questions so you can make an informed decision and ultimately _build an API that you won't hate_. Hey - see what I did there!?

This book makes no assumptions about your code or architecture. It is not a guide on how to version your CodeIgniter API. It will not help you paginate your Eloquent collection or optimise your MySQL replication. It will however help you to avoid making bad decisions and help you understand exactly what and API is.
