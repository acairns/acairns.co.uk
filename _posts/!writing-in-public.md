I wanted to explain why I've decided to share what I'm learning.

Learning is something I find enjoyable. It doesn't matter about the topic. From astronomy to the role of insulin - I'm curious about almost everything.

However, I've found this mostly-positive habit to not be without tradeoffs.

## Overconsumption

Over time I've come to believe there's an optimal limit to information consumption. Beyond this limit, we are no longer consuming content - our attention is being consumed.

Modern technology isn’t changing us. It’s changing society. The attention economy has commoditized our time and turned us into products to be bought and sold.

Consuming content can easily become entertainment. Edutainment in my case.

How much is enough?

## Mental models

Something about ideas forming and inspiration.

## Taking action

No identity change - I need to take action on what I learn. Increase accountability.

## Fear

I haven't been sharing my work enough because I've been scared of being judged by other people. I still have this fear, but I believe learning in public and sharing my thoughts and more of my work will help.

I could be totally wrong.

Got a different point of view or perspective?

Let me know! (be nice, please)

## Teaching

hei

I have started to write as a way to introduce a system preventing over-consumption, confront my fear of being judged, improve the mental models I create and put into practice the things I learn.

I'm beginning with LinkedIn posts and day-dreaming about a small podcast. I don't know how it will go - and I don't care. I'm not attached to the results, I'm more interested in the system.
