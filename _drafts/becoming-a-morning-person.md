Some notes about getting up early:

# Main Points:
- Has taken almost 5 months
-- Started on my birthday
-- Few spanners: having a baby, dexter/breaking bad addiction
-- End with: "my morning routine is now so important to me, that I no longer spend copious amounts of time watching TV at night"... or words to that effect.
- A daily routine starts the night before.
-- It may sound obvious, but it's true.
-- Example: If you are waking up and need to pack a bag before you can goto the gym - you won't be motivated to get up to do that.
- Dark mornings:
-- Make me feel like I'm attacking the morning
- 5:45 alarm, jawbone can wake me up to 20 mins before
- Swim at 6:30 sharp
- Swim is conquering demons, have never been a strong swimmer
-- Actually, my wife almost drowned me on our honeymoon!
- Was more productive at night, now productive early afternoon
- Coffee only in the morning, green tea afterwards
- Jawbone up, tracks sleep, wakes me up from light sleep
- Lift, helps me track good habits, celebrates the small wins
-- Getting up early
-- Stop eating at 8pm
-- Drink more water
-- etc.
- Meditation
-- Stigma, recommended by @leowid
-- Notice how my body feels
-- Be aware of my mood and how I feel (difficult at times)
- Scaling sleep
-- Find that post Leo wrote
-- Haven't mastered this at all
- Morning pre-work music playlist?
-- Get's me focused and pumped up to attack the day.
- Don't check email in the morning
-- Unless getting an early start to work
-- Never check email prior to a workout or swim
