I&#8217;ve seen a few people now share their Sublime Text 2 settings on either GitHub or Dropbox. Since I mostly use Git and GitHub these days, I fancied the idea so <a title="Sublime Text 2 User Settings" href="https://github.com/acairns/sublime-text-2-user-settings" target="_blank">here is my Sublime settings</a>.

Having just formatted to install Mountain Lion, there is nothing interesting here yet, but I love the idea. I loved the idea because I use Mac & Linux &#8211; often loosing my settings when updating Sublime on Fedora. Now I can share my settings between all my kit and ensure I don&#8217;t loose anything when I update on Linux.

The idea of adding something like this to version control never occurred to me but it has left me wondering something: what else I add to GitHub?!
