Last year was full of awesome and I've got a lot to be thankful for. As the new working year is about to commence, I've taken a little time to reflect and consider what goals I want to achieve in 2014.

One of the biggest changes to my life in 2013 (excluding the birth of my son) has been my increased awareness of wellbeing. 

In June, armed with my [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up), I made a lot of improvements to my sleeping habits. Now, I'm delighted to call myself a morning person, rising naturally at 5:20 most mornings. I also conquered a huge demon and learned how to swim. Now I'm in the pool most mornings as soon as it opens as part of my morning workout.

These are just parts of an overall daily routine which I track with the help of [Lift](http://lift.do). By using an app such as Lift, I've turned habits like: eat breakfast; drink more water; exercising and simple things like clearing my desk into a game.

It's amazing how much celebrating small goals contributed to my overall happiness and wellbeing - not to mention how much you can achieve when you take just one day at a time.

This year I'm conquering more demons and expanding my good habits. First up, I'm going to focus on training myself to become a [Writing Machine](https://lift.do/plans/242/become-a-writing-machine). I've always wanted to write about the amazing things I get to learn but usually struggle to find time. I also suffer from Dyslexia making me feel self-conscious about posting what I write publicly - this year, I want to change this!

_"Define your audience"_ is the first task - so let's get stuck in:

- Programmers in general
- Early adopters of Technology
- Experience working with Start-Ups
- Entrepreneurs or interested in Entrepreneurship
- Enjoys Life Hacking


This is the first step of 28. Hopefully I'll be able to stick to roughly 5 steps per week and crack this around February!

I'd love to hear how other people are planning to attack 2014, [drop me a tweet](http://twitter.com/andrewcairns)!
