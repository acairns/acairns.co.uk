<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a> is one of the best services to integrate when you need to accept payments online. It proudly describes its services as being *&#8220;developed by developers &#8211; for developers&#8221;*. After working with their API on several projects, it is obvious that this is the case. I have recommended their service to many developers and have seen it integrated with great success. But I don&#8217;t use Stripe myself.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Stripe and I would use it if lived in the US or Canada &#8211; but I don&#8217;t! That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.paymill.com/" target="_blank">Paymill</a> comes into play. Paymill, dubbed a Stripe clone, launched in August and has just recently made a huge leap forward in its attempt to capture the European market ahead of Stripe. Not long ago Paymill was only available in Germany, but it&#8217;s recent expansions mean they now cater for 32 countries including the UK, France, Turkey, Spain and Italy.

The battle between the new Payment Processors will certainly be heating up. Paymill&#8217;s expansion into Europe has been quite silent but I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t go unnoticed by Stripe who <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/19/stripe-kicks-international-expansion-canada-countries-way/" target="_blank">stated in September</a> that their roll-out into Canada was the first international expansion of many.

This is exciting news! I&#8217;ve yet to try Paymill, but the possibility their expansion into Europe could speed up Stripe&#8217;s internationalisation is exciting. In a few months I&#8217;ll be integrating billing into a new app &#8211; let&#8217;s hope by then UK start-ups will have a choice of good Payment Processors.
