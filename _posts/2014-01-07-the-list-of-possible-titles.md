Recently I [wrote a post](/2014/01/becoming-a-writing-machine/) about joining a plan on [Lift](http://lift.do) to [Become a Writing Machine](https://lift.do/plans/242/become-a-writing-machine). The first step was to identify my target audience. The next step is to identify some topic titles for articles I would like to write about. In the coming weeks, I'll be using this as a quick reference to keep the juices flowing.

Here goes:

1. Scripts for drafts with Jekyll
2. Customising iTerm2
3. [Adding iA Writer to command line](/2014/01/adding-ia-writer-to-command-line/)
4. Introduction to SplObjectStorage
5. Laravel, Ratchet and ZeroMQ
6. Hosting a site on GitHub
7. [Building a Vagrant base box with Bento](/2014/01/building-a-vagrant-base-box-with-bento/)
8. Remote working is the future
9. Raising your Rates
10. How to launch with a validated idea
11. I failed at meditation
12. Staying Focused and Motivated
13. Limiting distraction
14. How does the Pomodoro Technique work?
15. Saying No
16. Turn boring tasks into a game
17. Jasmine Tests in CoffeeScript
18. Open GitHub repo page via cli
19. Reduce HTTP requests with base64 encoding
20. Speed up Grunt watch by disabling spawn
21. Apache's VirtualDocumentRoot
22. Quickly SSH'ing with ~/.ssh/config
23. Parallax Scrolling with Skrollr
24. Speed up your tests with memory tables
25. Mocking Guzzle
26. Using Fractals to handle output
27. Repeat your own history


I found this to be quite interesting. Initially I struggled to reach the minimum 25 but then I hit a stride. It became easier when thinking about what I've played around with recently. Since I'll be using this list, I'll most likely change it in the coming weeks as I work on more interesting things, but I did find it an interesting exercise.
