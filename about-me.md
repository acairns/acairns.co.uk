My name is Andrew Cairns and I'm a Software Engineer living in Scotland. I've been building software since Turbo Pascal on Amstrad. That's an old programming language on an old computer.

I'm currently consulting a little while also building [Patchwork](http://trypatchwork.com), a tool to help charities share their stories.
