My name is Andrew Cairns and I'm a Software Engineer living in Scotland. I've been building software since Turbo Pascal on Amstrad. That's an old programming language for an old computer.

I'm the VP of Engineering at [GeckoEngage](https://geckoengage.com). I'm also building a simple tool to help [charities tell their stories](https://trypatchwork.com).
