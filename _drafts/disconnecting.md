I tried something different today. It's nothing new and I know a lot of people out there do this regularly - but I disconnected myself from the internet.

OK, I'll come clean - this wasn't entirely intentional. I'm lucky enough to be able to hot-desk at a company which are doing 'brown bag' talks. These take the form of presentations during lunch hours to knowledge-share with colleagues. Being able to listen in on these is tremendously valuable when you are working on your own.

What has this got to do with disconnecting? Well, for me it's 40 minutes away on the train. I used to do that journey in a previous life and I know that trying to get any Wi-Fi or tether your 3G mobile connection is pointless - so I disabled my Wi-Fi connection.

This is something I've wanted to experiment with for some time now. I'm very aware of the distractions that come when you work remotely - being highly connected with notifications from Twitter, Facebook and other sources can becomes a drain on your productivity. Using the Pomodoro Technique has worked well for me, but I've always wondered how well I'd get on being completely disconnected from the internet...

For me, the answer is - it kinda sucked...

I needed to pull the latest user uploads for a project - I couldn't do that. My source was out-of-date, I couldn't update. I'm integrating with third-party software, not a service I need to mock out, but without having access to their online documentation, I was definitely crippled.

Hunger also struck - even though I was away from home, I still had friends I could meet for lunch. Best way to reach these folk? You guessed it - I needed the internet to tweet them.

I learned a lesson today, doing a _"digital cold-turkey"_ just doesn't work - especially so if you are building online software like I am. That being said, I kinda loved being off-the-grid. I didn't feel the need to constantly check my email. Neither was I bombarded with any notifications from Skype or other forms of invasive instant messengers. I felt free.

Today was the first time I've attempted anything like this. In a strange way I'm glad I can call it a huge failure. Sure, I have a heavy night of work ahead of me so I can catch-up, but I've learned that disconnecting takes a little more planning.

Thinking about pulling the plug?
- Download any documentation for software or tools you may need.
- Update code, databases and assets the previous day.
- Stub off any third-party API dependencies.
- Ensure any travel arrangements are already made.
- Meeting friends? Plan a meeting place in advance.

I'm sure there are lots of articles out there with advice on disconnecting, but I can't help with those - I'm writing this offline remember!
