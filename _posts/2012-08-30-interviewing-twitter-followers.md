Having used Twitter for some time, I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to interview some of the amazing people that follow me on Twitter!Â I&#8217;ve realised that for a long time I am followed and have been following some really great people, but don&#8217;t know much about them. Hopefully I can change this and engage at a more personal level.

In true geek fashion, I think I&#8217;ll start by creating a script which randomly selects one of my followers &#8211; maybe using the Twitter PHP SDK. From there, I&#8217;ll try to arrange a quick interview over Skype.

If you follow me already and would like to nominate yourself, <a title="Andrew Cairns on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/andrewcairns" target="_blank">tweet me</a>!
