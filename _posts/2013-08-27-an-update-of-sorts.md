A lot of people that know me will know that I have a lot of projects in the works &#8211; along with a lot of contracting commitments. Most importantly though, my wife and I are expecting the first addition to our family in a few weeks!

For now, I've decided to focus on clearing my feet a little before our bundle of joy arrives.

Even though <a href="http://hatched.fm/" target="_blank">Hatched</a> hasn't been updated for some time &#8211; I fully plan on returning to it as soon as I free up some of my time. Followers will know that I use this to gain feedback from experts regarding a start up I'm working on. I've had several enquiries asking for a little more detail &#8211; which I promise I will reveal on the show when recording starts again.

Many of you will also know about the posts I'm writing forÂ <a href="https://medium.com/@andrewcairns" target="_blank">Medium</a>. These will be posted soon so follow me on Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/andrewcairns" target="_blank">andrewcairns</a>) to get my new content as soon as it's published.

Bye for now!
